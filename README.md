## Overview

### The challenge

This is a bit more difficult than the previous challenges as there are layout differences between the mobile and desktop designs. Tailwind made it very simple to implement. Also, I made it as dynamic as possible to fit many types of recipes, instead of hardcoding the recipe details.

## My process

### Built with

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### What I learned

- VueJS Component Emitting Events (apparently they have to be directly the parent, not the parent of the parent).
- Vue SFCs were helpful in organizing sections.

### Continued development

- For the nutrtions part, I wanted to use tables, but I didn't know how to style them as a lot of stuff like padding doesn't seem to work on tables. I was going insane so i just used a simple flexbox.
